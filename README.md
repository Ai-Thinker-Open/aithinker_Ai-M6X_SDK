# Introduction

**bl mcu sdk** is an MCU software development kit provided by the Bouffalo Lab Team, supports all the series of Bouffalo chips.

# SDK Versions & Chip Support

Note1：**drivers before v1.4.5 use v1.0（hal + std）, the later version will use v2.0 (lhal + soc)**。If you want to use **v1.4.5**, please checkout your branch to [release-v1.4.5](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_mcu_sdk/tree/release_v1.4.5).

Note2：due to the non-generic peripherals, the code style and interface name in **soc** are still the previous version, but will be subsequently updated to the new code style。

|   CHIP        |  v1.4.5  |  latest |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
|BL602/BL604    |  √       |   √     |
|BL702/BL704/BL706 |  √    |   √     |
|BL616     |  ×            |   √     |
|BL808     |  ×            |   √     |

## LHAL Support

**LHAL** is a low level hal driver for common peripherals designed by Bouffalo Lab, in order to support all the Bouffalo chips with the same api . Also it is convenient for users to use and port to other platforms.

Note：**√** means supported ；**×** means not supported；**○** means supported but not tested ；**-** means no such peripheral。

# Environment Setup

## Toolchain

- [riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc](https://gitee.com/bouffalolab/toolchain_gcc_t-head_windows) toolchain used in windows.
- [riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc](https://gitee.com/bouffalolab/toolchain_gcc_t-head_linux) toolchain used in linux.
- [linux-riscv64-linux-gcc](https://gitee.com/bouffalolab/linuxtoolchain_gcc_t-head) toolchain used for compiling linux code.

## Command Line Development

Before compiling with the command line, you need to select the corresponding toolchain according to your operating system, configure it to the system environment variables, and install the **make**, then you can do the following.

- Go to the demo directory where you want to compile and there are `main.c` and `Makefile` files in that directory
- Just execute the following command, take **BL616** as an example
- The first time you use it on Linux, you need to use `chmod` to configure the cmake permissions

```
cd bl_mcu_sdk
chmod +x tools/cmake/bin/cmake
cd examples/helloworld
make CHIP=bl616 BOARD=bl616dk
```

- If you use **BL808** or **BL606P**, you need to add **CPU_ID** with m0 or d0.

```
cd bl_mcu_sdk
chmod +x tools/cmake/bin/cmake
cd examples/helloworld
make CHIP=bl808 BOARD=bl808dk CPU_ID=m0
```
